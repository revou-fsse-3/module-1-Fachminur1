#### 2. Brief experience

I graduated from college in 2019. Starts from there. I started working as a *Merchandiser*, *Data Entry Officer*, and then currently as a *Cartographer*. Given my major from college was English major. I took lots of jobs that are not related to my major. So, I am eager to learn something new and try to gain as much knowledge as I can. That is why I choose to learn again from the beginning in Software Engineering Course.
